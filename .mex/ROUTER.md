# Session Bootstrap

If you haven't already read `AGENTS.md`, read it now — it contains the project identity, non-negotiables, and commands.

Then read this file fully before doing anything else in this session.

## Current Project State

**Working:**
- Skill (`skill/SKILL.md`) generates `spark.md` per `skill/format.md`
- Collector: scan, copy to a local folder or SMB share, prune stale files; systemd user timer
- Web app: card grid color-coded by priority/type, per-project page, optional login, `SPARK_MERGE`
- Three deployment routes documented in `INSTALL.md`: localhost, Docker (one container, collector loop), central server (Samba + Caddy)

**Not yet built:**
- Automated tests and CI
- Code-graph coverage: `.mex/graph.db` indexed 0 files at setup (Go), so the scaffold has no `grounds_to` entries

**Known issues:**
- No pruning when a scan finds zero files (by design), so the last removed project's card stays
- Web rereads and reparses the whole data dir on every request (fine at current scale)

## Routing Table

Load the relevant file based on the current task. Always load `context/architecture.md` first if not already in context this session.

| Task type | Load |
|-----------|------|
| Understanding how the system works | `context/architecture.md` |
| Working with a specific technology | `context/stack.md` |
| Writing or reviewing code | `context/conventions.md` |
| Making a design decision | `context/decisions.md` |
| Setting up or running the project | `context/setup.md` |
| spark.md format, parsing, priorities, sections | `context/snapshot-format.md` |
| Any specific task | Check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a matching pattern |

## Behavioural Contract

For every task, follow this loop:

1. **CONTEXT** — Load the relevant context file(s) from the routing table above. Check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a matching pattern. If one exists, follow it.
2. **BUILD** — Do the work. If a pattern exists, follow its Steps. If you are about to deviate from an established pattern, say so before writing any code — state the deviation and why.
3. **VERIFY** — Load `context/conventions.md` and run the Verify Checklist item by item. State each item and whether the output passes. Do not summarise — enumerate explicitly.
4. **DEBUG** — If verification fails or something breaks, check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a debug pattern. Follow it. Fix the issue and re-run VERIFY.
5. **GROW** — After meaningful work, run this binary checklist:
   - **Ground:** What changed in reality? Name the changed behavior, system, command, dependency, or workflow.
   - **Record:** If project state changed, update the "Current Project State" section above. If documented facts changed, update the relevant `context/` file surgically.
   - **Orient:** If this task can recur and no pattern exists, create one in `patterns/` using `patterns/README.md`, then add it to `patterns/INDEX.md`. If a pattern exists but you learned a gotcha, update it.
   - **Write:** Bump `last_updated` in every scaffold file you changed. Read `mex logging --json` before optional `mex log` notes: `significant` records material rationale, `checkpoints` batches useful notes at task/session boundaries, and `manual` avoids unsolicited notes. Honor explicit user log requests in every mode; mandatory workflow Activity and recovery audits remain required.
